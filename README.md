This object detection model was created from scratch as part of a bachelor thesis.
It was done under supervision by DEMOS and the goal was to have a first approach on object detection with small symbols.
The trained models are not optimized for production.
Annotation data (COCO) of tree symbols were used to train the model.
Pytorch, pycocotools, OpenCV, numpy and pandas were mainly used in this project.
